# figma-leading-trim

Figma plugin for trimming your text elements, removing space above capital letters and below the baseline. Make text behave the same as every other element in your layout.

This plugin works by nesting and offsetting text elements within frames.

To achieve the same behaviour in a browser, check out [Capsize](https://seek-oss.github.io/capsize) which this plugin uses internally.
