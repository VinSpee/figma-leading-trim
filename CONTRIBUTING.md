## Development guide

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Figma desktop app](https://figma.com/downloads/)

### Build the plugin

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically during development:

```bash
$ pnpm watch
```

To build the plugin for publishing:

```bash
$ pnpm build
```

This will generate a [`manifest.json`](https://figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/) file and a `build` directory containing the JavaScript bundles for the plugin.

### Install the plugin locally

1. In the Figma desktop app, open a Figma document.
2. Open Quick Actions (`Cmd + P`) and run `Import plugin from manifestâ€¦`
3. Select the generated `manifest.json` file.

### Debugging

To open the developer console, search for and run `Open Console` via the Quick Actions search bar. Just like in a browser, you can use `console.log` statements to inspect values in your code.
